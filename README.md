# Quechua
Two simple scripts that run EWP and DM models of Quechua agreement morphemes.

This is my first time uploading code to GitHub. I have a couple versions of each program on here, which I know GitHub is supposed to handle for me. At some point I'll add some branches and work on it that way. For now, just run the Perl scripts and see what they do. I'll add commentary later.
